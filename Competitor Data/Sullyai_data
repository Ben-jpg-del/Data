    "about": "I’m a U.S. Army Veteran turned SaaS Healthcare Sales Professional. After serving as a bomb technician, I took that same mission focus into sales, where for the past 5+ years I’ve built and grown new territories from the ground up.\n\nAt Tebra, I launched the Dallas-Fort Worth territory, building pipeline from zero and closing some of the region’s largest provider groups. At HelloKlarity (YC), I helped onboard providers to a telehealth platform and built partnerships with AANP and Headway. At Sully.ai (YC), I’ve been selling AI solutions into hospital systems, gaining enterprise sales experience. Earlier at Starry Internet (backed by FirstMark, Fidelity, KKR, IAC), I helped expand into new markets nationwide.\n\nMy bread and butter is provider-facing sales: being in the field, running demos, and building relationships that last. I’ve also driven growth through channel partnerships with Henry Schein, First Citizens Bank, and other healthcare networks.\n\nAlways open to connecting with others who share a passion for healthcare innovation and mission-driven growth.",

    "about": "With 15 + years driving sales and business-development success across US, UAE, and the wider GCC, I translate advanced technology into measurable, sustainable impact. Beginning in fast-paced SaaS and B2B settings, I consistently aligned data-driven sales motions with integrated marketing to unlock new revenue streams, shorten deal cycles, and boost customer lifetime value.\n\nRecently I have specialized in AI sales and machine-learning solutions—advising C-suite stakeholders on commercial strategy, de-risking adoption, and leading consultative, value-based selling that secures double-digit ROI within a year. My track record in forging strategic partnerships, government alliances,  regional system integrators, and emerging ISVs, with partner ecosystems now contributing up to 40 % of qualified pipeline.\n\nAs a sales and business-development leader, I build high-performing, cross-functional teams grounded in clear KPIs, coaching, and a customer-first culture. Whether spearheading new-market entry, structuring channel programmed, or negotiating multi-million-dollar enterprise deals, I remain passionate about empowering organizations to thrive in the AI-powered economy as well as human interaction—delivering outcomes that are both immediately measurable and sustainably scalable.",

However, it's often difficult to check the status of the trap: whether it's open or closed or if the right animal was trapped. Currently, researchers rely on cellular networks to get this information, but these can be spotty due to the traps' locations, which are often out in the wilderness and under trees. I alleviated this issue by creating the Trap Network System, an ad-hoc network created by LORA \"nodes\" of sorts, which would be connected to other traps in the network and strategically placed in locations to ensure the network was intact; as long as you could connect to one node in this network, you could be connected to any trap that you set up. This was programmed in C++, which was used to facilitate the connections between the devices, used to program what messages to send through the network, and the splitting of images to send through separate messages in the network."

He elevated because he was always working on improving the customer offering in real time and the organization saw the value in moving that energy and effort to the planning phase. We began speaking on a regular basis and I (and others) encouraged Jordan to pursue his MBA. It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing at Colorado University and with his endeavors in healthcare and venture capital. Jordan Liester has my highest recommendation!"

Jordan knows the value of incremental improvements and consistently looks for opportunities to improve processes, personal performance and team performance.\n\nJordan is a strategic thinker with an entrepreneurial mindset; he works well cross-functionally and delivers value to every conversation. \n\nI've worked with Jordan as both a manager and as a peer. He was a top-performer on my team, consistently exceeding quota while also taking on projects as a way to develop professionally. As a peer, Jordan and I collaborated on numerous strategic initiatives. His critical thinking skills, analytical rigor and exceptional interpersonal skills were constantly on display, making for productive and enjoyable collaboration. \n\nI would absolutely work with Jordan again and will be happy to speak to his skillset in more detail, upon request.

        "description": "I worked with Matthew at Sesame, the B2C healthcare company, where he was Head of Product Design and reported directly to me. Matthew oversaw all aspects of visual design, product design, UX design, and user research. He had a substantial impact on the company and helped Sesame deliver an experience on par with the best players in the industry. \n\nHealthcare is a hard domain to get right. Healthcare use cases are inherently complex. Matthew excels at understanding the users -- in our case, both providers and patients. He was able to set a north star that guided our strategy, and he worked with the team to craft beautiful, usable product designs that simplified complex healthcare workflows into a consumer-centric experience. We saw the results not just in how the product looks, but also in the metrics on acquisition and engagement. \n\nMatthew was able to achieve this by hiring an exceptional design team and providing the hands-on leadership they needed to do their best work. He raised the bar for the company, and he delivered on the highest stakes projects including Sesame's partnership with Costco. Matthew is a rare design leader who consistently elevates his team and leverages product design to drive business outcomes."

In addition, Matthew has helped me with several startup efforts. Matthew is one of the most thoughtful coworkers I have enjoyed working with. He is an excellent product designer who can think across user experience, user needs, research, and visual design. That would be enough, but Matthew brings a wonderful perspective as a member of a product leadership team across process, approach, leadership, recruiting, and so many other capabilities. I would always put Matthew at the top of my list of people to hire for a leadership role in product design, and any organization would be fortunate to have Matthew on its team."

A perpetual high-performer, Bruce helped to land & expand some of the largest deal in InVision history, while building a network of customers who love him, and consistently exceeded quota.\n\nAll of his success culminated into the past 8 months, in which Bruce was able to take his knowledge, experience, skills, and leadership to create leverage for our organisation by leading our EMEA Enterprise Sales team to being the most successful in our International business, contributing to over 70% of our H1 performance, and generating over 20% of our pipeline globally. \n\nBruce was able to quickly align & excite his team around a clear vision and purpose, allowing him to create a culture of collaborative competition amongst his reps. By being clear & explicit around his expectations, he was able to create accountability and effectively performance manage his reps to consistently create, progress, and close pipeline. Finally, by deeply investing in coaching through call reviews, deal strategy sessions, co-managing top opportunities, and normalising a culture of feedback, Bruce was able to lead his team through closing some of the biggest deals of their careers.\n\nBruce is one of the best sales leaders I've worked with, and I would hire him again in any sales organisation I lead full stop. If you have an opportunity for Bruce to join your company...take it!"

Angelica was a mind reader when it came to what needed to be done in day to day execution and always had great input in our long term roadmap. She was such an integral part of the team and everything we built that it was more than deserved that my CTO and I made her our third Co-Founder. Anyone who gets to work with Angelica is extremely lucky."

Mike sat down with each product leader, worked to understand what we were looking for, and began to transform our pipeline process.  Mike removed a significant top of funnel burden from the product leads by curating job fit screens, maintaining a high quality of prospect prior to leader involvement.  In his short time Mike filled 6 different roles for my team alone, and numerous others across the product org, including a number that had been open for over a year.  Mike internalized feedback for candidates who did not make it through the funnel, and took feedback from the leads well to zero in on the right candidates for the role.  Mike is always great to talk to, very personable, and did a great job of beginning to sell candidates throughout the funnel, leading to a high acceptance rate for those who we did offer the job to.  All in all I really enjoyed working with Mike, and am very appreciative for all the work he did to help the broader product org and I build an incredibly strong team!"

He had limited time and context about the product to work with, yet he delivered a handful of key insights and takeaways that our product team can use now and in the future—we implemented a few of his recommendations as soon as we read it in the report. I appreciate Zach's efficiency in receiving our request for feedback, and then providing a thorough evaluation. Also, it was great that he considered modern user experience values — i.e., AI, conversational UX, and human computer interaction — while providing his analysis for our product design."

He was highly respected and continually relied upon by the executive team for his financial expertise and guidance. In a fast-paced and deadline driven environment, Krassimir continually remained professional, patient and calm under pressure. At AGC, he displayed an incredible work ethic and was always willing to put in long hours, which was often required. He is extremely knowledgeable in Accounting and Finance principles and produced amazingly complex financial models that we still use today. Given Krassimir’s vast experience, education and genuine personality, he has both the character and strategic business sense of a leader. I look forward to one day working with him (or for him) again."

My expertise spans building scalable AI-driven SaaS platforms, designing robust microservices architectures, and mentoring technical teams to consistently deliver high-quality software.\n\nThroughout my career, I've comfortably shifted between executive roles—such as CTO driving organizational strategy—and deeply technical hands-on roles, including principal engineer directly architecting and coding critical solutions. I excel in environments where technical excellence and team leadership intersect, and I'm equally comfortable guiding teams as a manager or directly contributing to products as a senior technical contributor.\n\nCore Areas of Expertise:\n* Full-stack Engineering (TypeScript, Node.js, React, GraphQL)\n* Microservices & Serverless Architectures (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)\n* AI & Generative AI (OpenAI, LLMs, Prompt Engineering)\n* Technical Leadership & Engineering Management\n* Agile Methodologies & DevOps Best Practices\n\nI'm open to roles across executive leadership, engineering management, and senior individual contributor capacities.

When I joined the team in December as a Front End dev, I was surprised to learn that Jared had started only three months earlier since he was already so capable with the intricacies of our systems; it quickly became apparent that I would be learning from him and following his lead.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, he advocated for and consistently modeled best practices in everything we did.  Not only is Jared a true professional, he contributes with integrity and takes ownership.  He was an indispensable asset to the team, a mentor to me, and an overall leader.  Also, he is just super fun to work with and a pleasure to interact with.  For those wanting an invaluable contributor, Jared comes with my heartfelt recommendation."

He is not afraid to stand up against bad ideas and for good ideas, as well as hear out the ideas of others. He will express his ideas honestly without being hurt by push back. Because of this, he contributed greatly to the quality of code our team produced. He is a very positive person who would be a fantastic member of any team looking to come together and be the best."

At McKinsey I worked or consulted with close to one hundred companies and developed a clear view on what distinguishes real progress from the “dull twilight that knows neither victory or defeat.” (Note few transformation efforts are complete, resounding successes; though, unfortunately, many more are clear failures.)  Also co-wrote “Real Change Leaders” that made the case for a “new breed of middle managers to connect CEO aspirations with front-line realities.”   (In today’s lingo these would be “agile coaches.”)\nSince 2000, I have been in C-level positions for institutions of all shapes and sizes – but all facing significant “performance through people” challenges and the need for major change in strategy, skills, capabilities, culture, processes.  You name it.  \nThe common denominator?   A belief –born of research and experience – that organizations need to evolve (transform!) to do their best at serving their customers and employees.   And a deep respect for the realities and complexities of building high performing organizations.",

        "description": "I oversaw Aakash during the Summer BioDesign program. I saw him excel as not only a leader in a clinical setting but also as a creative innovator in generating and establishing economically viable solutions for pressing healthcare issues. His biggest differentiating factor is his tenacity and willingness to question current paradigms even when those facing the issue won't. The biodesign fellowship challenged Aakash to think critically about healthcare processes and problems and work with a team of engineers to propose solutions to everyone from basic scientists to hospital executives and physicians. Aakash demonstrated his leadership and drive for progress consistently by troubleshooting problems and advocating for positive change locally and nationally. \r\n"

That drive led me to teach myself how to sell online through Facebook and Instagram during the lockdown , and I haven’t looked back since.\n\nOver the last few years, I’ve run performance marketing across dozens of industries, leading growth strategies that moved the needle across:\n\n👕 Fashion and DTC clothing brands\n\n🛍️ Online fruit & vegetable marketplaces\n\n🍽️ Restaurants needing real sales uplift\n\n🧪 Pesticide & agricultural products\n\n🚧 Construction and finishing services (B2B lead gen)\n\n📱 Startup launches (e-com + B2C SaaS)\n\nI wasn’t just running ads. I was building growth engines ; from strategy to creatives, tracking to iteration. With one focus only: profitability and speed.\n\nToday, I’m part of the growth team at Sully.ai, helping scale an AI medical assistant trusted by 400+ healthcare organizations.",

He introduced me to many code patterns, frameworks, helpful articles, and other ways to improve myself -- in my career and as a person. He's very easy-going and, business aside, is also a great guy to know. He's an awesome engineer; highly recommended."
