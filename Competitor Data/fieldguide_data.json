Even before day 1, I felt very welcomed, and this was held all the way through our time at Atrium. He is incredibly approachable and remains grounded which I greatly respect from a leader.\n\nChris also helped tremendously with developing leadership skills. He was very patient when giving advice and helped me see things in new perspectives in times where I was stumbling.\n\nAs my manager, he helped defined goals and road maps that would align with the ultimate goal of the company. He gave me the opportunity to fully steer the course of the infrastructure which gave both of us more time to focus on higher leverage tasks. This was only possible thanks to Chris's ability to easily build mutual trust.\n\nIt was a privilege to have been working under Chris."

When he joined, Chris took time to meet with all of the engineers regularly and carefully listened to and responded to the feedback we had. In our meetings he always asked \"do you have any feedback for me?\" and accepted all feedback provided. As CTO at Atrium, Chris collaborated with the heads of the organization to find the most valuable product to work on and to promote internal adoption of the tools that we developed for internal users. Chris architected EPD's integration into every other department at Atrium and wrote out the processes to ensure their continued success.  I hope our paths cross in the future. "

My relationships with my teams, my customers, and my partners are why I have been able to achieve success in my career. \n\nI'm an innovative, results-focused, and operationally diligent executive.\n\nI’m fortunate to have been successful in both large-scale, global organizations such as Salesforce.com and as salesperson number 1 at organizations like PagerDuty.  The common motto I have lived by is to \"always be learning\". Whether that has been learning how to lead sales at a start-up, diving into a new market, or trying new methodologies to uplevel efficiency; I’m at my best when I am growing and being a conduit to up-leveling those around me. \n\nThroughout my career, I have driven revenue and hit targets regardless of economic and market conditions while also helping countless teammates achieve their career goals.",

I intentionally took an unconventional path to explore different career directions and gain hands-on experience. Looking back, I’m grateful for the exposure as it helped me discover the domain of work that I'm interested in and the environments in which I thrive.\n\nAdditionally, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to gain global exposure through the NUS Overseas Colleges program by spending time working at startups based in Silicon Valley (2024-2025) and Ho Chi Minh City (2023), where I immersed myself in the tech ecosystems and entrepreneurial culture.\n\nSince 2019, I have been diving into hackathons to solve meaningful problems during my free time. I enjoy rapid ideation, prototyping, and collaborating with teammates to pitch ideas that resonate with relevant stakeholders.\n\nAbove all, I love learning, building, and shipping things that make an impact 🚀",

As one of Carta's earliest SDRs, he rose through the ranks and was a critical part of the team's success in periods of industry-high hyper growth. \"Goose\" is low maintenance; crushes quota, always prepared and taking diligent notes, always asking the thought provoking questions and sharing best practices. He is the definition of a team player, and in my short tenure as his manager, Goose was one of our best.\n\nAny team would be lucky to have him for Enterprise Sales roles!"

    "about": "Don is passionate about working with entrepreneurs who build durable, generational businesses and is an early backer of ten $1B+ \"unicorns.\" His most well-known investment was in Deel where he wrote the largest seed check and enlisted numerous executives for key roles. He brokered hundreds of strategic partnership introductions which now account for very significant revenue.\n\nPreviously, he co-founded CityDeal, a b2b marketing technology business, which was exited to Groupon in the early days. Then, he built and ran Groupon's international offices with 500+ employees spanning Europe and Asia. He subsequently led BD at Airbnb globally and launched multiple offices both organically and through M&A. He constructed and ran the original high end listing and long term stays initiatives, which are multi-billion dollar revenue generating product categories today - LTS now accounts for 20%+ of Airbnb's revenue. Simultaneously, Don advised a variety of high growth startups such as Handy, which was an early Airbnb partner and made a marked impact on global listing quality. He has a track record of succeeding in highly competitive markets and has built or backed numerous tech industry leaders\n\nWhile an investment banker at Credit Suisse tech M&A group in San Francisco, Don worked on George Boutros' team on multiple blockbuster multi-billion dollar deals, including Submarino/Lojas Americanas (B2W), Google/Youtube, Google/DoubleClick, and many more\n\nDuring his junior and senior years in high school, Don ran a six figure online marketplace, which sold virtual and real world goods to Ultima Online and Everquest gamers. He went to the University of Minnesota for the majority of his high school course load and while in college at the University of Chicago, he attended courses with Nobel Laureate professors Robert Fogel and Gary Becker. His honors thesis surrounded the economic, anthropological and cultural impacts of the reunification of Germany",

        "description": "The Airbnb diaspora produced tremendous startups, unicorns, funds & consultancies, and I’ve been lucky to have a front row seat along the way\n\nI joined early days (2011) alongside a contract advisory group and wore hats including growth, ops and BD. We hired GMs globally, implemented new mkt playbooks, P&Ls - and developed and instituted new product lines such as Long Term Stays, High End, host and guest tools and services. New products that emerged have made a meaningful impact today - incidentally, Long Term Stays accounts for 10%+ (and growing!) of Airbnb's revenue. And the model led to a new class of startups - Boatsetter (boating), Onefinestay (Luxury), Swimply (pools), and more\n\nGeo expansion was complex, but also exhilarating - Airbnb Australia’s opening drew thousands from around Oceania and SEA and let to significant bookings and revenue. Passion was felt when we assembled at Sydney’s Cockatoo Island for our launch. Airbnb’s founders, investors and employees huddled together with thousands to celebrate\n\nDuring this period, reducing friction for hosts and guests was crucial; we tracked 13 KPIs, including check-in, checkout, location & cleanliness of a property. This led us to research services and startups catering to alternative accommodations —  laundry, food delivery, transportation. And it turns out on-demand cleaning was accelerating rapidly alongside Airbnb’s growth. Handybook, which shared co-investors with Airbnb, was the top player in the space, alongside the likes of Homejoy and multiple others. In fact, Airbnb built a customer service team dedicated to cleaning — and I took note.  Off the back of a number of tests, I decided to move over to Handy to help reduce the friction at Airbnb and orchestrated new product launches and staffing and is still used by many Airbnb hosts today\n\nOver the past decade, I’ve supported a variety of Airbnb alumni, including the spectacular AirAngels - a seed fund led by Airbnb alumni, where I’m an active advisor today",

For the international expansion he participated in building out the playbook, hiring the team (including country managers) and evaluating/sourcing partnerships; he established and ran our Australian office-- a strong team that is mostly still with us today. These were the early days for Airbnb so Don's versatility was a great help."

I brought her on board as the first member of a stellar support team, and let me tell you, she hit the ground running.\n\nShe's like a whirlwind when she dives into something new. Even though she was stepping into a part of the software world she hadn't navigated before, she didn't blink. She lowered her shoulder and charged right through, learning the ins and outs of the software, and delving into the \"why\" behind everything.\n\nBut it's not just her work ethic that's impressive. Kailey's got this infectious personality that makes everyone want to do their best. And the way she works with other people is truly human. If I could, I'd clone her and create an entire marching band of Kaileys, each one just as eager to learn from feedback and grow.\n\nWorking with Kailey was a stroke of good fortune. I can only hope our paths cross again in the future. Fingers crossed!"

No matter the leadership opportunities, Corey's practices always experienced record reoccurring revenue growth, an expansion of market share and lower than average attrition rates than experienced within industry.   These outcomes were a result of Corey’s ability at excelling in outlining and executing to actionable operational and strategic initiatives that ultimately translated into expanding shareholder wealth.  Corey was always well loved by his employees and a respected/trusted peer among those in the partnership.  His ability to mentor team members, maintain a trusted advisor relationship with clients and collaborate in executive leadership forums are some of Corey’s strongest business attributes.  "

We successfully implemented an enterprise risk assessment process prior to leading a successful Sarbanes-Oxley 404 initiative.  Corey proved to me his ability to pragmatically challenge the status quo through his perseverance toward leveraging \"compliance\" activities into value-added activities for the business.  I believe the risk assessment process he spearheaded at WestJet represents the most successful of its kind in my experience  Likewise, Corey was strong during the early days of SOx compliance in challenging our external auditors and SOx partners to rationalize requirements.  This was most clearly demonstrated in our successful push regarding general computer controls where D&T and KPMG accepted a reduced subset of COBiT as acceptable criteria for SOx compliance.\r\n\r\nCorey has the charisma, confidence and intelligence to succeed in successfully implementing change in organizations.  The ability to conceive and manage significant change from both a technical but also a change management perspective is rare."

He was one of the first product managers to join the team, and it is with his help that we were able to effectively introduce and implement agile practices within the organization. Stef is an extremely knowledgeable, thoughtful, and ambitious product manager. His impact was felt on day one, taking the initiative to teach himself the ins-and-outs of the product, become acquainted with cross-functional teams, and familiarize himself with our customer base. He recognized the need for a voice of the customer program, and excitedly took the lead to establish it; he quickly improved the connection to our customers, increasing loyalty and retention. Stef was always eager to take on the next challenge, and his strive for self betterment was inspiring. He was always asking the right questions-- the why and not just the what. It was such a pleasure to work alongside Stef, and managing him was a symbiotic experience. With his coworkers singing his praises, any company would be lucky to have him. I would hire Stef again in a heartbeat.  \r\n"

He is an awesome first marketing exec for any organization because he cares so deeply, has an analytical mind, and can execute across a wide variety of programs and projects to achieve success. This includes technical aspects of marketing, reporting and analytics, alignment with the field, enablement, digital and demand gen. He is collaborative by nature so you get someone who will really go hard at cross-functional projects until he finds success.\n\nDuring our time together at BetterUp, we scaled the organization's GTM significantly and Mark played a key role in the product, portfolio and global growth in the organization. He became my right hand where it came to planning, budgeting, and executing at rapid speed and could pinpoint opportunities for optimization.\n\nHe's a gem of a person to work with as well, with both a growth and owner's mindset."

These instruments enabled meticulous tracking of strategy execution and outcomes while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as the Sabine-Oxley (SOX) Act through diligent management of monthly accruals and forecasts.\n\nFurthermore, I led the pioneering development of a robust Vendor Rebate and Contract Management System, instrumental in driving 22% of EBITDA. Leveraging advanced technologies, I architected a comprehensive Business Intelligence platform and web application tailored to streamline vendor contract lifecycle management, encompassing terms negotiation, rebate tracking, and collections.\n\nUnder my guidance, the team conducted rigorous ROI analyses of over 150 vendor agreements, resulting in a notable $3 million enhancement in contractual terms, thus optimizing profitability.\n\nIn addition, my introduction of the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) project revolutionized early-pay discount collection processes. By applying Six-Sigma methodology, we achieved an 18% increase in discounts collected within a 12-month period, translating to a significant boost of over $300,000 in EBITDA.\n\nNotably, my contributions were recognized with the Leadership Excellence Award in 2015, underscoring my commitment to surpassing project goals and driving impactful change within the organization.",

From day one, Rachel translated complex pain-points—whether in prescription workflows, regulatory compliance, or patient safety into clear, actionable insights for our senior product leaders.\n\nWhat truly sets Rachel apart is her gift for influence. Rather than leaning on authority, she builds genuine relationships with leaders, educating them on latent risks, connecting disparate data points, and galvanizing consensus around strategic priorities. I’ve watched her turn skeptical directors into passionate champions for new digital initiatives simply by painting a compelling vision of what’s next and how we’ll get there safely.\n\nIn an industry where small oversights can have massive patient-care implications, Rachel’s forward-thinking vision and deep domain expertise have enabled us to deliver technical solutions that transformed the patient experience. Any organization fortunate enough to work with her will benefit from her foresight, her collaborative spirit, and her unwavering commitment to both business outcomes and customer well-being."

His willinginess to dig into issues, bring forward mutually acceptable options to overcome challenges, and his ability to work with CMH staff, helped in making the end users at CMH successful throughout the project.

I worked with Patrick when implementing a new set of features for a project that he had previously built and the entire experience was smooth and enjoyable. I was especially impressed with his React code; his code was organized, written, and documented as well as any other published projects on the web. I believe this alone does a great job of illustrating Patrick's competency as an engineer. I would definitely work with Patrick again at any point in the future."

As an engineer, Patrick is able to logically structure solutions to pressing problems and effectively communicate them to his teammates both in code and plain English.  During a particular project, he was tasked with teaching himself how to spin-up and use a Cassandra database, after which he was eager to assist the rest of his team. His knowledge in React/Redux played a pivotal part in every application we built. His skill set is valuable to any team.  \nPatrick is an intuitively empathetic person. He has the natural ability to tailor his communication and working style to that which best matches his teammates. As a result, he is very approachable and has a collaborative personality that melds well with any professional team."

With a background in product management, user-centered design, and data analytics, I enjoy turning ideas into real, impactful products that make a difference for users.\n\nAt Docusign, I’ve led product development for platform products, from concept to launch, including agreement workflows and third-party integrations. My work has helped expand Docusign's reach into other ecosystems through partner integrations and laid part of the foundation for Intelligent Agreement Management, a new category for agreements. In both products I focused on creating intuitive configuration experiences, reducing complexity, and making it easier for users to set up while cutting down time to publish.\n\nEarlier in my career, I gained hands-on experience in data analytics, data mining, and process automation, helping organizations streamline operations, boost reporting efficiency, and drive smarter decision-making. That data-driven mindset continues to shape how I build and scale products today, especially as I explore the transformative potential of AI-driven automation.",

He promotes trust and transparency within the teams he builds and the cross-functional leadership team he partners with. I had the pleasure of partnering closely with Syed in the early stages of our GTM motion. He built the customer success and support organization at Hummingbird from ground up, hiring a dedicated and inspired team. He created all the foundational processes for performance management within his team and closed the customer to product feedback loop. This included: driving product insights, expanding our customer footprint, and ultimately increasing revenue. Syed also understands customer motivations and can quickly get buy-in with senior stakeholders to create a successful outcome for the business. I would recommend Syed to any high performance organization looking for a dynamic and motivated CS leader."

Those are the customers who will not only stick around for life, but also refer their friends and family.\n\nLast month, we discussed why a high customer churn rate is bad for business and shared three tips for improving the customer experience.

I am excited to see all that Sara accomplishes in her career!"

My time at NUS College, the honors college of NUS, has broadened my horizons with interdisciplinary exposure to statistics, literature, sociology, writing, and research. My global exposure, from having lived in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, has enriched my worldview and instilled in me a flexible mindset essential for navigating the dynamic landscape of technology and business.\n\nEager to translate my academic knowledge into real-world impact, I am actively seeking practical experiences within the technology industry. I look forward to embracing new challenges, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and continuing my mission of leveraging technology to shape a better future.",

George is a wizard, the kind of engineer that knows the answer no one else does, who always has a suggestion when the rest of the team is stuck, who can see a whole system and understand the various moving parts (and often he's the only one in the room who can). You can learn a ton from him just by watching him work and talking through a problem (and everyone on the team has). He is passionate not only about well-composed software but also about system health and resiliency, and he is a go-to person during incidents, when the app needs troubleshooting, or when tackling a complex technical challenge, whether piloting a platform upgrade or designing and implementing a new ELT pipeline. He's made immeasurable contributions to the app (in all parts of the stack), and he is always ready and willing to offer help or advice to any member of the team. George is one of the smartest and most talented colleagues I've ever worked with, and will be an incredible asset to any organization he works with."

Kristen has a very analytical and operational mindset, which sets her apart and allows her to be extremely efficient. She methodically navigated the territories she covered, leveraging data to drive the strategies she employed, and saw much success as a result. Kristen had tremendous growth in her time in seat. She's coachable, pragmatic and has a hunger to learn. Any organization would be lucky to have Kristen as part of their team."

The hypothesis was that the friend relationship would show more influence on someone’s memory as opposed to the stranger relationship.  This influence would be indicated by friends exhibiting more modifications in memory than the strangers’.  Individuals watched one of two videos of a staged robbery attempt.  Afterward, the participants answered a series of questionnaires to determine their memories of the event. Each video had subtle differences from the other (i.e., in one video the suspect was wearing a red and orange hat and in the other video the suspect was not wearing a hat at all).  Differences between the first and last questionnaires showed whether or not the individual’s memory of the event had altered as a result of collaborating with another person.  The current collected data show no significance t (12) = -.481, p > .05.",

As a professional who values dedication, organization, and attention to detail, Jenny truly stands out as an exceptional individual.\n\nThroughout our time working together, Jenny showcased remarkable organizational skills that greatly contributed to the overall success of the event. Her ability to keep multiple tasks and responsibilities in order was truly impressive, allowing our team to stay on track and meet critical deadlines with ease.\n\nJenny's attention to detail was second to none. She consistently demonstrated a keen eye for accuracy and precision in her work, ensuring that every aspect of the event was executed flawlessly. Her commitment to maintaining high standards positively impacted the quality of our deliverables and left a lasting impression on both clients and colleagues alike.\n\nBeyond her exceptional organizational and detail-oriented capabilities, Jenny's planning abilities were truly phenomenal. She approached each project with a visionary mindset, anticipating challenges and devising innovative solutions to overcome them. Her forward-thinking approach was instrumental in navigating complex situations and achieving outstanding results.\n\nOne of Jenny's most outstanding qualities is her ability to remain cool, calm, and collected, even in high-pressure situations. No matter how challenging the circumstances, she approached every obstacle with a composed demeanor, inspiring confidence in the team and ensuring a positive work environment.\n"

She not only threw great events (with all right little details, selected carefully and specifically for the event, audience, theme) but was also super detail-oriented.  I could always trust her to follow through and execute with excellence. \n\nAs she grew at Procore her responsibilities grew and she began to manage the entire events team, while keeping strong relationships with field marketers, and other department heads.   Externally she built lasting relationships within the industry which not only helped us get the right deals, first rights of refusal, etc. but also built real partnerships with associations (which are key in the construction industry).  I hope our paths cross again someday."

Shoshanna is an exceptional HR professional whose impact goes far beyond her impressive 6+ years of experience.\nWhat sets Shoshanna apart is her rare ability to balance empathy with strategic thinking. She has a genuine passion for people development, which shines through in every initiative she undertakes. Shoshanna consistently demonstrated a keen ability to drive growth through innovative HR processes while never losing sight of the human element.\nHer approach to benefits management was particularly noteworthy. Shoshanna skillfully balanced company needs with employee well-being, implementing programs that boosted retention and kept Instawork competitive in the talent marketplace. Her decisions were always well-informed, considering both data and the personal impact on team members.\nShoshanna's leadership style is both inspiring and effective. She creates an environment where team members feel valued and motivated to perform at their best. Her strategic vision, coupled with her deep understanding of HR best practices, makes her an invaluable asset to any organization.\nBeyond her professional skills, Shoshanna is a joy to work with. Her positive attitude, open communication style, and willingness to tackle challenges head-on make her a natural collaborator and problem-solver.\nAny company would be fortunate to have Shoshanna on their team. She's not just an HR professional; she's a true advocate for creating workplaces where both people and businesses can thrive. I wholeheartedly recommend Shoshanna for any senior HR role or leadership position."

        "description": "Aditya was our Sales Operations Intern at SpotHero in the summer of 2017.  Aditya was a tremendous asset to our team and accomplished a great deal in his time working with us.  Aditya's performance  aligned beautifully with many of SpotHero's most critical values.  \"Act like you're in the driver's seat\": Aditya was self motivated and worked with a great deal of autonomy.  He was presented with goals and given the freedom to determine how to execute.  He was incredibly thoughtful, hustled, and was ultimately very successful.  \"Don't get stuck in traffic\": Aditya was tenacious and dogged in his pursuit of goals.  He ran into some pretty significant obstacles and refused to back away from the challenge.  He repeatedly figured out ways over, under, around, and through problems.   \"Fuel relationships\": Aditya developed outstanding relationships with his co-workers and fellow interns.  \"Remember to signal\": Aditya is an outstanding communicator.  As his manager, he was in regular communication with me around his accomplishments, progress towards goals, and any blockers.   \"Drive growth\": Aditya's efforts and results have helped our sales professionals to better understand their assigned markets.  The impact of his work will provide lasting value to our team. \n Moreover, Aditya drove his own growth, tackling many challenges in areas he initially lacked familiarity with.  He learned and assimilated new skills fearlessly.  Though Aditya was an intern, he was also an incredibly high functioning, fully contributing member of our team.  I'm excited to see where Aditya heads from here."

        "description": "Tamika is incredibly passionate about her work as a recruiter. She is maniacal about finding the right candidate to fill the roles on our team and is equally concerned that candidate is happy long term at the company and in the particular job. \n\nTamika is always looking for ways to improve processes and effectively implements them. Her suggestion of shifting to a structured hiring process with standardized questions, and a panel interviewing style has improved our outcomes immensely. We are faster at hiring and finding candidates who are a better fit for our team/the role. Tamika genuinely goes above and beyond with process and people. She takes time with candidates and hiring managers to make sure everyone has a clear understanding of the role and processes. She shares my sense of urgency when it comes to hiring and is always timely from phone screens, to scheduling interviews, to pushing for approvals, to negotiations. Tamika is natural project manager and a strong communicator which are hugely important in ensuring that candidates and hiring managers up to date. I truly love working with Tamika. She is kind, driven, smart, and incredibly hard working. I am so grateful for her improvements in our recruitment process and continued commitment to helping us find the best candidates."

        "description": "Tamika recruited me for my position in Programmatic Media in October of 2016. I can't speak highly enough about the incredible work she does and how amazing she made the experience. She was incredibly attentive and responsive the entire time. She was 100% transparent about the recruiting process as well as every aspect of the eventual job.\r\n\r\nAs if my above words of praise are not enough, Tamika pays such close attention that she helped me pivot into a new career. She recommended my current position to me based off my resume and after hearing my career goals. This was not a self-serving decision either, she genuinely listened and thought the position would be a great fit for me (turned out she was very correct) and so recommended as much. I'm incredibly happy in my new role now and it's all due to Tamika.\r\n\r\nI've dealt with Recruiters in the past and none have been as honest, responsive and enjoyable to work with as Tamika. I'd recommend her a million times over to anyone. You won't find anyone better, I promise that."

I relied on his expertise on a very regular basis and I couldn't have accomplished much of it without him.  Once we had a full time Sales Ops role filled, Dan again was extremely helpful with onboarding and continued to be a great resource with anything from simple tasks to complex projects.  \r\n\r\nHis ability to balance multiple projects and interact with every team in the company is fantastic.  Well liked, hard working, deeply knowledgeable and dedicated, Dan is a rare breed that is able to transcend from just being an engineer to someone that acts like he is a team member on every team.\r\n\r\nI fully recommend Dan for a multitude of roles and would be grateful to work with him again."

He jumped in on the project, was able to make immediate improvements, and has been instrumental in building out a customer solution that covers our sales, customers success, marketing, product and management teams.  Dan is a strong systems architect, but also a strong communicator - a rare combination.  I highly recommend him and hope to have the opportunity to work with him again at some point!"

        "description": "Elise is an extremely creative, independent, self-starting individual professionally dedicated to the mission and vision of the work she undertakes.   She has a strong work ethic, is detailed oriented, yet clearly understands the importance of the administrative and people side of her work.  Elise often completed tasks ahead of schedule and went above and beyond what was necessary to complete the projects she worked on for The Arc.  Elise was always thorough in her work, had a positive and professional demeanor, and was a true asset to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.  She also communicated her ideas well and was very open to constructive criticism.  I and The Arc staff appreciate all that Elise has done to ensure that The Arc is and will be successful.  Elise succeeded in all aspects of the projects she undertook and at a calibar unseen by most of her peers.  On behalf of The Arc Greater Twin Cities and myself, we feel any organization, school, or institution would be lucky to have Elise and her skill set."

        "description": "I recently had the opportunity to work with Tory on a full branding package for my new business. I cannot recommend Tory more highly - both in terms of her communication and expertise in guiding me throughout the process - and even more so as a designer. Through every step of the process Tory held the ideal balance of guiding me and seeking my input to create a brand and package that is exactly what I was after.\n\nShe started the process by getting to know my business and its 'personality.' She asked very clear questions about what I was after and then took my answers to design our new logo. She came back with several options (something she did throughout the process), and for each option she gave her own insights - but also made it very clear that I should listen to my own gut instincts to guide the process. I was bowled over by what she came up with - the logo I chose is EXACTLY the type of thing I was after, and surpassed my expectations. It's professional, fun, creative, layered, and fits in all of the attributes I asked for.\n\nShe then used that logo to guide the rest of our process: setting up colors, fonts, letterhead, social media, business cards, etc. In all cases her ideas were so creative and on-brand, that I actually came to understand branding and its importance in a whole new light just through this process.\n\nAnother important note: at a few points along the way I second guessed my answers or changed my mind. Tory took those things - that I know from experience can be frustrating from a client - completely in stride. She was a complete professional who adapted to my requests effortlessly, and weighed in when I was stuck. Any time I was nervous to committing to such big choices for my company, she made it easy to make sure we were moving ahead with the right plan. She never made me feel pressured or rushed, in fact I admired how much of an investment she had in making sure everything felt right before we moved on to the next step.\n\nThe cherry on top came in the handoff process, where Tory gave me an extremely comprehensive and highly organized breakdown of my brand assets. Everything is already exactly how I need it to reference it for all applications, and I have a customized guide to refer myself, my teams, or contractors to on how to implement the branding.\n\nHer design skills and creative instincts are unquestionable, and the fact that she knows how to be so organized and professional in implementing the process makes working with her again and recommending her a no brainer.\n\nAs a new business, Tory created us a logo and brand that I feel we owe it to ourselves to grow into - that's how rad it is."

Accomplished this by building a suite of tools that included an API, CI/CD tool and a UI that takes an OpenAPI document and generates/updates and promotes the proxy into higher environments. \n\n- Developed an organization wide dashboard to display information on APIs within Thomson Reuters, including the amount of traffic each API gets, their associated business unit and what API Platform they’re using. Achieved this by continuously gathering logs and metrics from Apigee and AWS API Gateway and computing metrics on the logs by using Kinesis, Kinesis Analytics and lambdas. \n\n- Trained colleagues on how to design and build cloud native applications in AWS.\n\n- Built and managed several internal APIs using Node.js, AWS Fargate, Code Pipeline and CloudFormation to help enable TR’s API strategy.",

This is a domain that is highly specialized, complex, and has a tough learning curve. It is also one of the most difficult areas to design for. Cameron took the challenge head on, and his growth within our group was incredible to see. Cam dove deep into the domain, spoke to customers, led research, and was able to lead highly impactful projects. Cam was the design leader for some of our most used accounting surfaces, as well as R&D lead for future-looking innovations.\n\nAbove all, what I admire with Cam is his resilience, grit, and self-drive. He demonstrated he is capable of pushing through tough problems and situations, collaborate effectively with engineering and product partners, and deliver high-quality ideas and products. I would recommend Cam for any high-velocity team with ambitious goals."

        "publishedAt": "Stanford Digital Repository · Jun 7, 2024",
        "description": "Speakers' tendency to include redundant information in their referential expressions appears to challenge theories of efficient and pragmatic language use. Specifically, this overmodification occurs more frequently with color modifiers than with size modifiers. While existing hypotheses seek to explain this phenomenon based on various properties of visual scenes or of human language, manipulating these properties in experiments with human participants is often infeasible or impossible. We propose to address this limitation by adopting neural networks as our learning agents. Through a series of controlled experiments, we manipulate properties of the learning environment during language acquisition to study the effect on the agents' downstream language production. We find that overmodification can emerge in pragmatic agents, but that this emergence is sensitive to various design choices regarding model architecture and hyperparameters. We discuss the effect of each of these design choices on overmodification and analyze their benefits and drawbacks, ending with a set of recommendations for future work."

        "publishedAt": "Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (2022) · May 18, 2022",
        "description": "Speakers' referential expressions often depart from communicative ideals in ways that help illuminate the nature of pragmatic language use. Patterns of overmodification, in which a speaker uses a modifier that is redundant given their communicative goal, have proven especially informative in this regard. It seems likely that these patterns are shaped by the environment a speaker is exposed to in complex ways. Unfortunately, systematically manipulating these factors during human language acquisition is impossible. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by adopting neural networks (NN) as learning agents. By systematically varying the environments in which these agents are trained, while keeping the NN architecture constant, we show that overmodification is more likely with environmental features that are infrequent or salient. We show that these findings emerge naturally in the context of a probabilistic model of pragmatic communication.",

From our first day together, I was impressed with her curiosity and eagerness to learn about different avenues of digital marketing. Her self-starting work ethic shined through immediately as she was tasked to complete projects outside of her time in the office. She has a natural knack for being creative and came up with a unique, 3 month campaign that the co-founders loved and was ultimately implemented. Her ideas and communication style made working with Petra so easy and fun! Petra's professionalism and drive will guide her to nothing but success in her future endeavors. She will be missed!"

In this position as a marketing intern, Petra helped develop some of the outbound marketing collateral and communications as well as helped us maintain our group's SharePoint site which we used for internal communications.\r\n\r\nBased on my experience working with her, I would highly recommend Petra for another year as an intern for our team. Her work was very high quality and she came up to speed very fast and quickly became an asset to the team.\r\n\r\nPetra was easy to work with and was well liked by the entire team. She has a can do attitude and was able to complete the tasks that we needed her to accomplish with limited direction from the team. I truly enjoyed working with her."

He joined Real Magnet early 2016, and we worked together on multiple projects. Driven by natural curiosity and having aspirations for learning and applying new technologies, he led our team transforming front-end infrastructure of a large enterprise application to a new level - from jQuery and AMD modules to webpack, TypeScript, ES6, React, and all neat tools and CLIs.\n\nAfter Real Magnet was acquired by Higher Logic, Matt played a tech lead role and architected React component library and the front-end side of Higher Logic’s Unified Admin platform. Besides that, he also successfully built and deployed several other complex front-end projects. \n\nMatt loves challenges exploring new tech, always on the lookout for best practices, and encourages the team to follow them. We used to have this saying at Higher Logic: “Ask Matt, he knows everything!”.  It was always fun to tackle new problems together, brainstorm crazy solutions, and pair program with so smart team mate! I’ll definitely miss our team work, and hope one day we’ll again work together on something great!"

Her attention to detail and strong work ethic make her a valuable asset to any team.\n\nI have no doubt that Angela will excel in any challenge she takes on and I recommend her for any opportunity that comes her way.

I was impressed with Shawn the moment I interviewed him for a Marketing Assistant position at the UCF Recreation and Wellness Center. From his contagious, positive attitude, to his limitless creativity, Shawn inspires everyone around him without even realizing it. He steps up to the plate whenever he is needed, and exceeds your every expectation. \r\n\r\nShawn's ambition and determination also outweighs the fear of any challenge. When I met Shawn, he had never worked in graphic design programs, but he was eager to learn. I watched his skills drastically improve week to week, and as a result, one of his designs won an award for Marketing Campaign of the Year. Overall, Shawn is everything you could ever want in an employee. He is inherently motivated and performs every task with a smile on his face. Any company would be lucky to have him."

Over the years, I’ve built a reputation for driving impact through strong communication, project management, and a client-first approach.\n\nOutside of my full-time role, I launched Momentum Career Coaching, where I help early-to-mid career professionals land their next role, pivot industries, and earn promotions. Through resume reviews, LinkedIn optimizations, mock interviews, and personalized career strategy, I’ve turned years of informally mentoring colleagues and friends into a structured, results-driven coaching practice.\n\nWhether in SaaS implementation or career coaching, my focus is the same: making complex challenges feel simple, actionable, and achievable.",

    "about": "13. That's how many schools I've attended before college. 13 schools, 13 transitions, and 13 life-changing moments. Making new friends every year was disheartening then, but I wouldn't be where I am today socially if it weren't for those experiences. I learned how to push myself out of my comfort zone and help others feel comfortable and appreciated. These experiences were life-changing because they molded my life doctrine. \n\nIf what you do helps people, why not keep doing it? All my career goals and life decisions revolve around how I can create the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach worked fine till the fateful day I attended an SAT Prep Conference. I stayed back and asked what score I should shoot for. \"A score of 1200 is about average, but since you're Asian, you should probably shoot for 1400.\" It was only when the Harvard lawsuit came out that I learned the importance of valuing diverse perspectives. \n\nCreating a diverse environment is just as important as developing new ideas and technologies for this simple reason. If the people designing solutions to the world’s problems aren’t representative of the people they are trying to help, then they won’t be able to help those people effectively. That's why I want to pursue research in neural networks. The interdisciplinary nature of neural networks opens up the ways I can help the world, and it also allows me to ensure that a technology that's becoming increasingly pervasive in our world is developed in an ethical and equitable fashion. Change starts today, right here, right now.\n\nThat's the essence of who I am and what drives me to strive for new heights, always learning, and always growing. Here are a few fun facts about me!\n\n1) I love playing Dungeons and Dragons, and I've been playing D&D 5e for about 7 years now\n\n2) I've been playing the trumpet for 10 years, and I enjoy playing jazz music and improvising solos\n\n3) I absolutely adore the horror genre, especially films. My favorite is Nosferatu (the first horror movie that was also silent!)\n\n4) I am a play geek. From local playwrights to international superstars, I love poring over and analyzing one of the toughest mediums to portray the human condition through\n\n5) I got stabbed with a javelin in my foot at track practice once. Thankfully nothing serious, but it sure gave me a story to tell\n\n6) I have what some may consider an unhealthy obsession with rap music and African American culture from the perspective of music",

        "description": "The sheriff's office of my local community commissioned a project to modernize an educational aide used to educate pre-school students about road safety. The aide was a \"talking\" bike that played a tape with built-in delays that the presenting officer. This combined with LED's for eyes created the illusion of the bike being alive.\n\nThe scope of this project included modernizing the components (e.g. - transitioning from a cassette tape to an SD card, using a microcontroller to consolidate the electronics, etc.) and making the presentation interactive by adding new features to make it more personal (e.g. - being able to program the name of a student if it was their birthday, pause/play feature, etc.). \n\nThe constraints of this project mainly boiled down to keeping costs low while working with only one point of entry on the UI. The officer can interact with the bike using only a key fob remote. This presented unique challenges that boiled down to packaging powerful functionality with four buttons. \n\nThe development of this project started with just design and not too much code. I went through several ideas to change the UI such as running a web server and having a website run behind the scenes to having a photoresistor that would read hand gestures. At the end, the simplest and most cost effective solution came down to using a 4-button key fob that communicated with an Arduino Uno board using an RF receiver. The Arduino would communicate with a speaker that could be turned on/off and would perpetually power the LEDs with preprogrammed changes to the expressions.\n\nSince my matriculation at Caltech, I have passed this project down to the AI/CS club I founded my senior year of high school to keep the project closer to the community. It allows me to pass it forward to the next group of passionate developers in my community. I am still a part of the project in a consulting/advisory capacity assisting with the software development aspect of the project.",

        "description": "For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by how we were able to trick a rock into thinking only by putting lightning in it. I’ve spent every waking moment trying to understand what this rock can do to sate my own alarming curiosity. \n\nThe first step to learning more about my rock was to ask questions, and my curious nature eventually led me to answer the biggest question of all. How can I make my rock learn? I was getting bored of giving my rock every single step and I really wanted it to move out and start living independently. This led me to the glorious world of neural networks. I found great resources online explaining how to start working with neural networks right now, but I came across an issue. Every ‘tutorial’ I found only focused on how to use an existing framework. That was not the depth with which I wanted to evolve my rock. I wanted to know more. I wanted to go deeper. I wanted to answer \"Why?\"\n\nThat's when I committed myself to build my very own neural network from scratch. 6 months of arduous self-research and sleepless nights debugging code led to my very own neural network framework built from scratch. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it for the intimate knowledge that I now posses of every part of rudimentary neural networks. From the backpropgation to the classifiers & optimizers to the neuron itself, I knew why everything was designed the way it was. I could now go beyond just classifying images of dogs & cats and go to the next step of analyzing frames from a video game and telling the character what to do.\n\nThe reason this project is ongoing because there is so much more to the world of neural networks than the window I glimpsed through. From GAN's to Q Learning to Quantum Machine Learning, there is so much more I intend to understand at the same level I understood the basic neural network model I worked on. There is joy in unlocking these new capabilities of my rock to improve and create new ways of helping the world.",
