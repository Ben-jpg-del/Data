He joined Real Magnet early 2016, and we worked together on multiple projects. Driven by natural curiosity and having aspirations for learning and applying new technologies, he led our team transforming front-end infrastructure of a large enterprise application to a new level - from jQuery and AMD modules to webpack, TypeScript, ES6, React, and all neat tools and CLIs.\n\nAfter Real Magnet was acquired by Higher Logic, Matt played a tech lead role and architected React component library and the front-end side of Higher Logic’s Unified Admin platform. Besides that, he also successfully built and deployed several other complex front-end projects. \n\nMatt loves challenges exploring new tech, always on the lookout for best practices, and encourages the team to follow them. We used to have this saying at Higher Logic: “Ask Matt, he knows everything!”.  It was always fun to tackle new problems together, brainstorm crazy solutions, and pair program with so smart team mate! I’ll definitely miss our team work, and hope one day we’ll again work together on something great!"

From our first day together, I was impressed with her curiosity and eagerness to learn about different avenues of digital marketing. Her self-starting work ethic shined through immediately as she was tasked to complete projects outside of her time in the office. She has a natural knack for being creative and came up with a unique, 3 month campaign that the co-founders loved and was ultimately implemented. Her ideas and communication style made working with Petra so easy and fun! Petra's professionalism and drive will guide her to nothing but success in her future endeavors. She will be missed!"

In this position as a marketing intern, Petra helped develop some of the outbound marketing collateral and communications as well as helped us maintain our group's SharePoint site which we used for internal communications.\r\n\r\nBased on my experience working with her, I would highly recommend Petra for another year as an intern for our team. Her work was very high quality and she came up to speed very fast and quickly became an asset to the team.\r\n\r\nPetra was easy to work with and was well liked by the entire team. She has a can do attitude and was able to complete the tasks that we needed her to accomplish with limited direction from the team. I truly enjoyed working with her."

This is a domain that is highly specialized, complex, and has a tough learning curve. It is also one of the most difficult areas to design for. Cameron took the challenge head on, and his growth within our group was incredible to see. Cam dove deep into the domain, spoke to customers, led research, and was able to lead highly impactful projects. Cam was the design leader for some of our most used accounting surfaces, as well as R&D lead for future-looking innovations.\n\nAbove all, what I admire with Cam is his resilience, grit, and self-drive. He demonstrated he is capable of pushing through tough problems and situations, collaborate effectively with engineering and product partners, and deliver high-quality ideas and products. I would recommend Cam for any high-velocity team with ambitious goals."

        "publishedAt": "Stanford Digital Repository · Jun 7, 2024",
        "description": "Speakers' tendency to include redundant information in their referential expressions appears to challenge theories of efficient and pragmatic language use. Specifically, this overmodification occurs more frequently with color modifiers than with size modifiers. While existing hypotheses seek to explain this phenomenon based on various properties of visual scenes or of human language, manipulating these properties in experiments with human participants is often infeasible or impossible. We propose to address this limitation by adopting neural networks as our learning agents. Through a series of controlled experiments, we manipulate properties of the learning environment during language acquisition to study the effect on the agents' downstream language production. We find that overmodification can emerge in pragmatic agents, but that this emergence is sensitive to various design choices regarding model architecture and hyperparameters. We discuss the effect of each of these design choices on overmodification and analyze their benefits and drawbacks, ending with a set of recommendations for future work."

    "about": "13. That's how many schools I've attended before college. 13 schools, 13 transitions, and 13 life-changing moments. Making new friends every year was disheartening then, but I wouldn't be where I am today socially if it weren't for those experiences. I learned how to push myself out of my comfort zone and help others feel comfortable and appreciated. These experiences were life-changing because they molded my life doctrine. \n\nIf what you do helps people, why not keep doing it? All my career goals and life decisions revolve around how I can create the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach worked fine till the fateful day I attended an SAT Prep Conference. I stayed back and asked what score I should shoot for. \"A score of 1200 is about average, but since you're Asian, you should probably shoot for 1400.\" It was only when the Harvard lawsuit came out that I learned the importance of valuing diverse perspectives. \n\nCreating a diverse environment is just as important as developing new ideas and technologies for this simple reason. If the people designing solutions to the world’s problems aren’t representative of the people they are trying to help, then they won’t be able to help those people effectively. That's why I want to pursue research in neural networks. The interdisciplinary nature of neural networks opens up the ways I can help the world, and it also allows me to ensure that a technology that's becoming increasingly pervasive in our world is developed in an ethical and equitable fashion. Change starts today, right here, right now.\n\nThat's the essence of who I am and what drives me to strive for new heights, always learning, and always growing. Here are a few fun facts about me!\n\n1) I love playing Dungeons and Dragons, and I've been playing D&D 5e for about 7 years now\n\n2) I've been playing the trumpet for 10 years, and I enjoy playing jazz music and improvising solos\n\n3) I absolutely adore the horror genre, especially films. My favorite is Nosferatu (the first horror movie that was also silent!)\n\n4) I am a play geek. From local playwrights to international superstars, I love poring over and analyzing one of the toughest mediums to portray the human condition through\n\n5) I got stabbed with a javelin in my foot at track practice once. Thankfully nothing serious, but it sure gave me a story to tell\n\n6) I have what some may consider an unhealthy obsession with rap music and African American culture from the perspective of music",

        "title": "Sherrif's Office Bike Project",
        "description": "The sheriff's office of my local community commissioned a project to modernize an educational aide used to educate pre-school students about road safety. The aide was a \"talking\" bike that played a tape with built-in delays that the presenting officer. This combined with LED's for eyes created the illusion of the bike being alive.\n\nThe scope of this project included modernizing the components (e.g. - transitioning from a cassette tape to an SD card, using a microcontroller to consolidate the electronics, etc.) and making the presentation interactive by adding new features to make it more personal (e.g. - being able to program the name of a student if it was their birthday, pause/play feature, etc.). \n\nThe constraints of this project mainly boiled down to keeping costs low while working with only one point of entry on the UI. The officer can interact with the bike using only a key fob remote. This presented unique challenges that boiled down to packaging powerful functionality with four buttons. \n\nThe development of this project started with just design and not too much code. I went through several ideas to change the UI such as running a web server and having a website run behind the scenes to having a photoresistor that would read hand gestures. At the end, the simplest and most cost effective solution came down to using a 4-button key fob that communicated with an Arduino Uno board using an RF receiver. The Arduino would communicate with a speaker that could be turned on/off and would perpetually power the LEDs with preprogrammed changes to the expressions.\n\nSince my matriculation at Caltech, I have passed this project down to the AI/CS club I founded my senior year of high school to keep the project closer to the community. It allows me to pass it forward to the next group of passionate developers in my community. I am still a part of the project in a consulting/advisory capacity assisting with the software development aspect of the project.",

        "title": "Neural Network From Scratch",
        "description": "For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by how we were able to trick a rock into thinking only by putting lightning in it. I’ve spent every waking moment trying to understand what this rock can do to sate my own alarming curiosity. \n\nThe first step to learning more about my rock was to ask questions, and my curious nature eventually led me to answer the biggest question of all. How can I make my rock learn? I was getting bored of giving my rock every single step and I really wanted it to move out and start living independently. This led me to the glorious world of neural networks. I found great resources online explaining how to start working with neural networks right now, but I came across an issue. Every ‘tutorial’ I found only focused on how to use an existing framework. That was not the depth with which I wanted to evolve my rock. I wanted to know more. I wanted to go deeper. I wanted to answer \"Why?\"\n\nThat's when I committed myself to build my very own neural network from scratch. 6 months of arduous self-research and sleepless nights debugging code led to my very own neural network framework built from scratch. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it for the intimate knowledge that I now posses of every part of rudimentary neural networks. From the backpropgation to the classifiers & optimizers to the neuron itself, I knew why everything was designed the way it was. I could now go beyond just classifying images of dogs & cats and go to the next step of analyzing frames from a video game and telling the character what to do.\n\nThe reason this project is ongoing because there is so much more to the world of neural networks than the window I glimpsed through. From GAN's to Q Learning to Quantum Machine Learning, there is so much more I intend to understand at the same level I understood the basic neural network model I worked on. There is joy in unlocking these new capabilities of my rock to improve and create new ways of helping the world.",
